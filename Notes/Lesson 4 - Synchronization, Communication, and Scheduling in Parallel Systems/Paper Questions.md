1. There is a bug in MCS barrier algorithm on Page 19 of the paper. First 10 folks to (independently) report the bug and the fix correctly (no credit if the bug reported OR the fix reported is incorrect) correctly to the TA will get 1% credit towards the course total of 100%. (Send him an email with the subject "CS 6210 MCS Bug".) 
2. The MCS paper claims that the MCS algorithm may be the best for large-scale cache coherent multiprocessors. Argue why this may not be necessarily true. Hint: See the discussion of barrier algorithm implementation and results in pages 8-10 of the "scalability study of KSR-1" paper which is a suggested reading for project 2. 
3. MCS paper shows results that MCS barrier does better than tournament on a bus-based shared memory machine like the Sequent Symmetry. Explain why this is so. 
4. Anderson lock algorithm uses arrays and MCS algorithm uses linked list, but both are variants of maintaining a FIFO queue of lock requests. 
	1. (a) Comment on the space requirements of Anderson algorithm versus MCS algorithm. (b) Which of the two variants will work better on a shared memory machine that does not support hardware cache coherence? Why?
