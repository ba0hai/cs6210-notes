## General OS Structure Questions
1) Microkernel based OS will always be less efficient compared to Monolithic kernel. True or False? Explain your answer in detail. 
2) To what extent has the idea of configurable system services (SPIN and Exokernel) influenced commercial operating systems? (Note: For the sake of this question, any flavor of Unix and Microsoft Windows fall under commercial OS). You have to clearly explain how they have been or have not been influential, and back such statements with facts and reasons.
