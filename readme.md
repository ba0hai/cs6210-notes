As of December 2024, this is a WIP repository. 

Here are notes for Georgia Tech's OMSCS class, CS6210, or Advanced Operating Systems. This is meant to be used in an Obsidian vault. 

These notes are made for my own personal use so there are certain quirks about them. The notes under the Notes directory are primarily based on lectures. 

Papers are pulled from [mohamedameen93's github repository]('https://github.com/mohamedameen93/CS-6210-Advanced-Operating-Systems-Notes'), including the review questions associated with each paper.
